lion holding the meat
bird peeping through the nest
chawa throws spear
i nao stabs his grit
lifting the sumer mountain
old man holding the melon
mon supports the pillar
impaling the stake
extinguish the lamps
crocodile sweeps its tail
break the elephant's tusks
serpent twists its tail
bird somersaults
the giant catches the monkey
break the elephant's neck
complimentary tricks
elephant thrusting its tusks
foot touches face
giant steals the girl
rama pulls the arrow string
tiger descends into the stream
deer looks back
mountain overturns earth
serpent sneaks to the ocean kingdom
hanuman the monkey king presents the ring
vietnamese casts a fishing net
thayae kham sao
swan with broken wings
threading the flower garland
monk follower sweeps the floor
slicing the cucumber
